          <p> Fremont Border has been lost for some time. His girlfriend has become distant, his family apathetic; his best friend hasn’t changed at all. To cope, he’s relied on drink, drugs, and lucid dreaming. He wants to escape London. He he wants to go and sell mangoes on a beach.</p>

            <p> One chilly morning he wakes at a bus stop, groggy and hungover, to find a note on his lap. He follows the instructions of the note, which leads him to meet Orla: an urban nomad with a mysterious past. Through this chance encounter, Fremont becomes exposed to a new way of living. Curiosity, beauty, and adventure abound, though it’s clear there’s something she’s not telling him.</p>

          <p>   When Orla’s secrets begin to mount and his best friend sinks into a world of trouble, Fremont finds he is more alone than ever.</p>
          <p>
          Should he stay in London with those he loves, even if it means living with disillusion and regret? Or should he take after Orla and pursue a life that may yet save his soul?

          <h2><span>Notes from the Roof of the World: Afghanistan's Wakhan Corridor and Beyond</span></h2>
        </div>
        <div class="projects-content">
          <p> Afghanistan's Wakhan Corridor is the gateway to the Little Pamir: one of the most remote inhabited places in the world. Sandwiched between China, Pakistan and Tajikistan at over 4,000 metres, the Little Pamir is home to Kyrgyz nomad settlements and the stunning Lake Chaqmaqtin. It is also about to change forever, as Chinese authorities begin work on a highway that will bring the valley hurtling into the 21st century.

              Olly Lawson’s firsthand account—written in diary form—sheds light on a region rarely explored by Westerners. When he is let go from his job as a travel agent the day before departure, he suddenly finds the trip assuming an importance beyond mere adventure. Accompanied by two former colleagues, the trip sees them endure a grueling ten-day hike, nail-biting car journeys and an assortment of memorable characters.

              With soaring descriptions of the landscape and snippets of philosophical musings, these travel notes will take you from leafy London to the Roof of the World in no time.

          <p> An ambitious director will leave no stone unturned in her production of a fiendishly difficult and disturbing
            play. The Maiden's Toy features a fast-moving account of the weeks leading up to the unveiling of her new production
            and focuses on the director's increasingly twisted relationship with her young leading male. New writing exploring the pursuit
            of perfection and the boundaries that must be crossed to acheive it.
