          <p> An ambitious director will leave no stone unturned in her production of a fiendishly difficult and disturbing
            play. The Maiden's Toy features a fast-moving account of the weeks leading up to the unveiling of her new production
            and focuses on the director's increasingly twisted relationship with her young leading male. New writing exploring the pursuit
            of perfection and the boundaries that must be crossed to acheive it.
