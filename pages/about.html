<blockquote>
  Words matter. That's why people love to quote their favourite films or song lyrics. Why oral storytelling
  has been at the heart of our communities since our first days of connecting the things in our head with coherent
  streams of language. Why so much of it survives today, from Greek epics to the Icelandic sagas. Why businesses
  employ content writers, celebrities biographers, artists amanuenses. Why politicians pore over speeches. Why
  people can be hurt, empowered, dejected or inspired by them. Because words do matter. And to me they have
  always mattered a lot.
