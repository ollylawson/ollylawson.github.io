  Words are important. That's why people quote their favourite films, poems, or song lyrics. Why storytelling has been at the heart of our communities since the first days of connecting things in our head with streams of language. Why so many of these stories survive today, from Greek epics to the Icelandic sagas. Why businesses employ content writers; politicians speechwriters; celebrities biographers; artists amanuenses. Why people can be hurt, empowered, dejected, or inspired by them: because words carry weight, because they matter. And to me, as someone who has wanted to be a writer since he was a little boy, they have always mattered a lot.
<br><<br>
Across these pages you will find a selection of my work across a variety of mediums. Some have come from darker times, some from places of great hope, but they have all come from a place of curiosity: about myself, about other people, about this bizarre world of ours, and of course about this confounding puzzle we call life. I hope there is something to be found here for everyone.
<br><br>
There are exciting times ahead and I would love for you to join me on my journey to become a better writer, a more astute chronicler, a more trusted voice in telling as many stories as it possibly can.
