<b>Covid-19 is the latest in a long line of misfortunes to strike the bountiful island of Sri Lanka. Despite this, hope endures amongst locals that better times lie ahead.</b>

Kumar Ratnayake, 52, has exactly the kind of voice you would expect from a man who has survived decades of civil war, a tsunami, terrorist attacks, a near-fatal run-in with a leopard, and who is now living through a dystopian pandemic. It is not just gravelly but downright abrasive. It’s like he’s got sandpaper lodged in his throat and that his voice, which must begin somewhere with pure, melodic intentions, cannot help but emerge from his mouth scratched, coarsened — disfigured, even.

He is speaking to me over the phone from a dormitory in the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo. Kumar shares the room with three other chauffeur-guides. The beds are wire-framed, the sheets jaundiced. The air vent breathes in a rattle; such is its struggle to contend with the 40-degree heat outside.

Kumar should not still be in the dormitory. Ordinarily it functions as his base during peak travel season (December to March), where he stays the odd night in-between fortnight-long tours around the island. Once his duties are complete, he returns to his young family in Yala, over on the southeast side of the island. It is technically the off-season in Sri Lanka now — whatever that whimsical notion means — however a curfew on the city ensures there is no chance of him leaving any time soon.

“It has been two months in this room, my friend,” he says, in that inimitable, scraping husk. “Of course I miss my wife and children, yes, but I am used to it. And even when the curfew ends I must stay here and hope to find work.”

For Sri Lankans of Kumar’s vintage, Covid-19 is just another storm to weather. He and his compatriots have absorbed untold horrors and difficulties over the years, and they have managed to find a way to flourish in the aftermath of each and every one.

“In many ways,” says Kumar, “we Sri Lankans are like our national flower: the blue lotus. We have tough roots that sink deep into the mud. We are good at enduring.”

I first met Kumar in October 2017 during a “familiarization” trip with the travel company I was working for at the time. He greeted me at the airport with a salute. He had a bristly black moustache, neatly cropped hair, and was dressed in a crisply ironed shirt, black chinos, and shiny shoes that clacked on the marble of the arrival lounge floor.

We proceeded over the next month to travel all over the Teardrop Isle. We explored the island’s verdant jungles, the Cultural Triangle’s ancient ruins, the Tamil fishing town of Jaffna, the white sands of the east coast, the misty highlands of Tea Country, the arid plains of the national parks in the south, and the crumbling, terracotta-roofed fort town of Galle — build by the Dutch in the 16th century.  We had many long conversations. And we have stayed in contact ever since.

One such conversation centred on Kumar’s experience during the Boxing Day tsunami in 2004. We had stopped for some fruit at a wooden shack by the road. A lady in a blood red sari carved us up one of her luminous pineapples and sprinkled it with chili salt. We sat on tree stumps and bit chunks out of the luscious fruit, letting the golden juice run over our chins. It was one of the best things I had ever tasted: sweet, salty, hot, sour, all at once.

“I was a fisherman in those days,” said Kumar, as he wiped his mouth with a polka-dot handkerchief he kept in his pocket. “I remember the sea leaving the shore. It went so far out; no one knew what was happening. All of the fish were left on the dry seabed hopping about. So, of course we ran and started collecting all of them. We thought it was a Christmas miracle — a Christmas feast!”

Alas. Kumar said he survived the devastation wrought by the seething mass of water by seeking refuge on a rooftop. He told me then as we ate pineapples — and he insists on it again now as we talk on the phone — that it made him grateful for the little things in life. It is an experience he draws on during difficult times; namely last year, during the Easter bombings, and this year, during the government-imposed curfew designed to protect its civilians from a deadly, invisible virus.

It also made him turn to religion. He has been, since 2004, a devout Christian. I remember him stopping at shrines to St. Anthony whenever we were within reasonable distance of one. He parked the car by the roadside, excused himself, and hurried off to pray. The majority of the island is Buddhist (around 70 per cent of the population), with sizeable Muslim and Hindu minorities, but faith of all kinds — so Kumar believes — explains the unique capacity for Sri Lankan people to resolve during times of hardship.

“We can only leave everything to God,” he says over the phone. “I pray all the time that this coronavirus will go away from us all as soon as possible.”

One of the few comforts he affords himself is the idea that his compatriots, his country, his family are like the blue lotus. He certainly fears for his ability to support the latter financially. He hasn’t yet been able to find any alternative form of work. So for now he prays.
