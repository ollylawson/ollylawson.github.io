<i>Safi Usmani (second from left) wants to restore his country’s reputation among travellers. I met him for the first time on the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan</i><br>


I meet Safi Usmani in unusual circumstances. There are packs of heavily armed men prowling around us; there is a caged bridge that does not invite crossing; there is a tobacco-coloured river surging with snowmelt, crenellated fences, coils of barbed wire and padlocks the size of mess tins. There&#39;s the Hindu Kush hulking above us. There is No Man&#39;s Land, featureless and silent. There&#39;re the competing flags of Tajikistan and Afghanistan flapping in the breeze. And then there&#39;s him, Safi—all baby blue robes, jet-black hair and fiercely tanned skin.

 &quot;Hello my friend!&quot; he says, waving as if we&#39;re childhood friends catching up after _too long_. It&#39;s hard to believe he hasn&#39;t been superimposed on the scene. He has a reedy, singsong voice—not unlike Kermit the frog&#39;s—but it betrays the seriousness of his ambitions: he, along with a few like-minded individuals, is determined to resuscitate Afghanistan&#39;s tourism.

 &quot;Come, come,&quot; he says again, beckoning me past the pack of surly looking Tajik soldiers. &quot;We stay at Marco Polo tonight—very nice guesthouse, you will see.&quot;

 And so I do. I follow Safi through the Afghan checkpoints and into the front of a sleek white Opel. He then drives us into the frontier town of Ishkashim, where we stop outside a sand-coloured house tucked away between high metal fences. He leaps out of the car, bangs twice on the gate and then proceeds to steer us through the opening that appears. This is Marco Polo guesthouse. Were it not for Safi&#39;s word, there would be no way of knowing this.

 He encourages me to settle in and shower before joining him for some food. I do as he says, noting the AK-47 hanging from the wall of my room and the swaying marijuana plants in the garden. By the time I am clean and hungry, Safi is waiting for me cross-legged in the dining room. He has an air of timelessness about him—an elegance and economy of movement that suggests he is never in a rush. I ask him if he is always like this:

 &quot;Oh yes,&quot; he replies, his brown eyes twinkling, &quot;Always relaxed with guests. Always calm; I enjoy the company too much.&quot;

 This is one of the great perks of his job, he tells me. Two years ago he decided to set up Noshkh Wakhan tours—a travel agency specialising in trips to Afghanistan&#39;s stunning Wakhan Corridor. In 2017 170 people visited the region. In 2019 the annual figure reached 408.

 &quot;It has been a long time coming,&quot; says Safi. &quot;Before 9/11 many tourists come to Afghanistan. They come for shrines, fortresses and nature, but then the war changed everything.&quot;

 Safi held numerous other jobs in those difficult years, years that in fact continue to pass as political tensions continue to run high. He was a teacher at Ishkashim high school, an officer for the World Food Programme and a clerk for the Independent Election Commission. In 2009 he started learning English and computer programming—skills he now employs daily to advertise his business on the Internet and on social media sites like Facebook. He says it is his new job that gives him the greatest satisfaction:

 &quot;I have gained many friends in this role,&quot; he says, as he pours out a cup of tea. &quot;I have also learned a great deal about many different countries and cultures. What is best of all however, is that I am able to employ many local people. Cooks, drivers, porters, guides. Tourism brings more facilities to Ishkashim—this after many difficult times of no jobs, no money, no improvement.&quot;

 And what does he make of the Chinese-funded road being built down the Wakhan as part of the Belt and Road scheme? To me it seems a horrifying prospect—a tarmac scar mutilating the wilderness of the valley—but Safi, as I get the feeling he does with each and every tourist he receives, challenges my preconceptions.

 &quot;To you, for tourists, this is not good news. China wants access to Afghanistan, and Westerners think this is a deal with the devil. For us however, this offers healthcare, schools, transportation. This is good news indeed for us.&quot;

 But what if it affects the tourism trade, I ask.

 &quot;Then so be it my friend,&quot; says Safi. &quot;Tourism is our best way of improving our lives at the moment. If tomorrow the best way is with China, then that is the way we must go.&quot;

 His selflessness is touching. It&#39;s also highly unusual. The tourism industry typically rewards brash, insatiable greed, but not here, Safi&#39;s country has seen too much to be hoodwinked by such promises. Either way—road or no road—the future looks promising for Afghanistan&#39;s brutally beautiful eastern frontier.
