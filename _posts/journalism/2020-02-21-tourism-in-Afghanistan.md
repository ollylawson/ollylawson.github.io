Tourism had more affected in ishkashim wakhan they brought more facilities in ishkashim wakhan The people earned money such as guide, driver, cook, guesthouses, hors man ect.
Wakhan is historically place in our country during history alto of visitors visiting in this place that things important in this place ancient tradition lifestyle and good natural in 2017 at lest 170 people visiting ishkashim wakhan and 2018 at lest 300 people visiting in this year til now 408 people visiting ishkashim wakhan our company had 104 guests this year.
If someone ask you have to respond to them never war in ishkashim wakhan during internal war The people very kind and hospitality there is more famous fortress shrine natural before internal war every year more than 2000 tourist come ishkashim wakhan when started internal war never tourist come after events of 11 September Americans come to Afghanistan with clation forces brought new system in Afghanistan someone want to see  Afghanistan when they come to ishkashim on that time was not good for tourist because lost more time for paper work transpiration was very bad no good car also the price was very high right now Afghanistan government try to  bring more facilities wrote price for every thing car ,guide. Guesthouses.  another problem in the past all guide didn't have licences now with out  licence not allowed to work also establishes sevral company in ishkashim wakhan it have effect increased tourist.
High way sarhad broghil to buzi gumbad Chanis want access to Afghanistan try open this way this way good news for kyrogyz nomadic and wakhi shepherd never they access to school, healthcare, transportation after opening this way they can access everything i think only not good for that who want treking.
