&#39;Why&#39;s it called that Mummy?&#39; asked the little girl.

 &#39;Why&#39;s what called what darling?&#39;

 &#39;_Cobalt Cove_- it says it there on the surfboard.&#39;

 &#39;Ah so it does. And I&#39;m not sure, maybe it&#39;s because the water is that funny shade of blue. _See_.&#39; Mummy pointed out the great wide expanse of ocean before sighing to herself and lowering her arm again. Earlier that morning, back in the cosy B&amp;B they were staying in, Evie had noticed she was wearing the same underwear two days running. Of course she&#39;d seen the bloody water. She saw everything.

 &#39;I don&#39;t like that name.&#39;

 &#39;Well madam,&#39; said Mummy, without hint of surprise at her daughter&#39;s objection, &#39;unless you&#39;ve packed a surfboard of your own, I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re going to have to accept it.&#39;

 &#39;But the water is so beautiful and welcoming and &quot;cobalt&quot; sounds so cold and hard and not very nice at all.&#39;

 &#39;You&#39;re quite right honey. Cobalt is actually a metal you see, so that&#39;s very perceptive of you to-&#39;

 &#39;I bet a boy named it that.&#39;

 Mummy nearly choked on the jam sandwich she&#39;d, at that very moment, stuffed into her mouth. &#39;What on earth makes you say that?&#39; The lumpy clump of wholemeal bread stubbornly clung to her throat. She hoped she&#39;d not sounded too proud of her daughter.

Evie shrugged and wrapped her fingers around the handle of the car door. &#39;Boys always try to seem cold and hard. Colin does. Finn does. Cilian does. Miss Day told me in secret it&#39;s because they watch too many superhero movies- they&#39;re always cold and hard. Like Iron Man, which _ _is a_lso_ a metal.&#39;

&#39;Which teacher told you-&#39; Mummy shook her head and stopped herself, deciding that she would rather not know. She clambered out of the car. Evie, idolatry to the last, followed her example. &#39;Not all boys are cold and hard darling.&#39;

&#39;Daddy was.&#39;

Mummy was thankful she&#39;d left the rest of the sandwich on the dashboard. &#39;Now look sugar plum, we&#39;ve spoken about this before- Daddy was going through a difficult time at work and he just needed some space. I&#39;m sure before long he&#39;ll be back being all warm and soft again.&#39;

Evie looked suspicious before turning to peer down over the edge of the cliffs.

&#39;Don&#39;t get too close darling.&#39;

&#39;I bet it was _those_ boys that named it _Cobalt Cove_.&#39;

Mummy followed her daughter&#39;s gaze. A huddle of topless white torsos were gathered on the beach below. At the rise of a sudden gust, their boyish cackles could be heard echoing up through the air. &#39;Come on,&#39; said Mummy, taking her daughter by the hand and leading her down the crudely cut stairs jutting out from the rockface.

Down on the sand- half henna half hazel, divided by the line of the tide- an old man was bent over a portable stove. Steam moistened his weather-beaten features. His glasses were misty too. A small, hand-written sign advertised tea, coffee and biscuits. Mummy took a step towards it, but she felt a strain of resistance in her left-hand.

&#39;What now darling? Don&#39;t you want a digestive? You can dunk it in the tea and everything.&#39;

&#39;No thank you, I want to ask those boys why they named this place _Cobalt Cove_.&#39;

&#39;Right,&#39; said Mummy, exhaling through her nostrils as only a well-practiced mother could. &#39;So you&#39;re just going to march over to that group of boys and ask them that are you?&#39; Evie folded her arms and nodded. Mummy recognised _that_ look all right, and wondered if her daughter hadn&#39;t practised it in the mirror. &#39;Well go on then, what&#39;s stopping you?&#39;

&#39;I want you to come with me.&#39;

&#39;Darling,&#39; said Mummy, subconsciously stooping a little, as she always did when she tried to explain something as simply as possible. &#39;I&#39;m going to get some tea from that nice old man over there. It&#39;s a little chillier down here than I thought and those boys probably don&#39;t want to be disturbed-&#39;

&#39;Why are they in a big group? They&#39;re always in big groups.&#39;

&#39;They&#39;re surfers, they&#39;re probably just talking about the waves.&#39;

&#39;I bet they&#39;re talking about girls. I bet they&#39;re saying mean things about them.&#39;

Another chorus of cackles cut through the air. Mummy looked up through her eyebrows at the boys. They were slapping each other on the back, leaving the pink imprint of their fingers to glow and fade across pale skin.

&#39;I guess we&#39;ll never know,&#39; said Mummy, breaking the chain of their hands to ruffle her wavy hair.

Satisfied that that was the end of that conversation, she continued on towards the Tea Man, waving at him as she went. He noticed her only after the third flail of her arm- and promptly wiped his glasses sheepishly on his fleece. A toothy smile accompanied his apology at having not seen her earlier.

&#39;And what can I get you ma&#39;am?&#39;

&#39;Oh well,&#39; said Mummy, rubbing her hands together like two sticks in search of fire, &#39;I would absolutely love a cup of tea please, two teas actually, and a few digestives if you have them.&#39;

&#39;Absolutely no problem ma&#39;am- and would you like them both now or would you like me to pour you a fresh one when you&#39;ve finished the first?&#39;

&#39;Why-&#39; Mummy turned around. Evie was no longer by her side. Instead, she was a good sixty-yards away, marching up to the gaggle of surfers. Mummy watched as, first one, then two, then all seven or eight of them, sensed the presence of an incoming alien. They scattered to form a semi-circle.

&#39;The young lady seems to know her own mind all right, if you don&#39;t mind me saying.&#39;

&#39;You have no idea.&#39;

&#39;I just hope she lets them down gently! Too many of the ladies around here are a little reckless when it comes to those poor boys hearts.&#39;

Mummy didn&#39;t know what to say to that. Besides, she had eyes only for her daughter. She watched as Evie put her hands on her hips and began what looked like a stern remonstration. The faces of the surfers straightened at once.

&#39;Here you are ma&#39;am,&#39; said the old man, passing the tea over her shoulder. Mummy fumbled for a grip on the piping paper cup. &#39;I&#39;ll keep the second one warm until she&#39;s finished with them. Not finished with them- you know what I…&#39;

The old man&#39;s sentence faded in the wind and it was sometime before Evie finished her lecture. The surfers to a man maintained their sincerity throughout, and their wiry torsos were stiff with attentiveness. A few nods broke out at what looked like appropriate intervals. A couple even looked up briefly to the sky, searching for a thought. The tallest of the group then took it upon himself to speak first in reply. His brow furrowed as he spoke, and soon it was Evie that was nodding along to his words.

Back and forth the replies then came, as a few more of the surfers mustered the courage to speak. Each time they would take a half-step towards Evie, as if supplicants to a monarch, before retreating back to their rigid, semi-circle formation.

The tea was soon tepid and untouched, and still Evie had not finished. It was only when another gust of wind sent one of the surfboards shooting away over the sand that the spell seemed to break. One hurried after it, catching it just before it was snared by the snapping jaws of the sea. The others began to bow and a couple even shook Evie&#39;s tiny blue hands.

Mummy&#39;s mouth was still hanging open as she watched her daughter skip back towards her, her wavy hair billowing behind her.

&#39;One tea please,&#39; said Evie, as she came within earshot of the old man. &#39;And I would _love_ a biscuit if you have any.&#39;

The old man roused himself from his own absent-mindedness and muttered something about &#39;just a sec.&#39; Mummy meanwhile just stared at her daughter.

Evie thanked the man and took a big slurp, wincing a little at its temperature. The two of them then turned in silence and headed back up the steps to the top of the cliff. Here they then retreated back to the comfort of the car.

It was a good few minutes before either of them said anything.

&#39;Mummy?&#39;

&#39;Mmm?&#39;

&#39;The heating- I asked you twice if we could put it on- it&#39;s so chilly.&#39;

&#39;Yes, yes, sorry, of course.&#39;

She turned the key in the ignition and prodded the control panel. Warm hair soon washed over them. Evie took another slurp of tea before crumpling the cup in her hand and dropping it at her feet. &#39;So, where to next?&#39;

Another drawn out pause.

&#39;I think you might just have some explaining to do before we mosey on.&#39;

Evie&#39;s pretence of innocence didn&#39;t last long. &#39;You want to know what I said to the boys.&#39; Mummy nodded. &#39;Well,&#39; she began again, as if she was being asked the question for the thousandth time, &#39;I asked them what they were laughing about to start with-&#39;

&#39;Not why it was called _Cobalt-_&#39;

&#39;Mummy please don&#39;t interrupt the story, whenever I do that to you you say it&#39;s rude.&#39; Her eyes flashed with a playfulness that Mummy found utterly disarming. &#39;_As I was saying_, I asked the boys what they laughing about and they told me. They said that they were telling jokes-&#39;

&#39;What kind of jokes? Not rude-&#39;

&#39;_Mummy_!&#39;

&#39;Sorry, sorry.&#39;

&#39;They were telling jokes to make Neil- that&#39;s one of the boys- feel better about getting dumped by a girl called Sophie. I then asked what &quot;dumped&quot; meant and they told me it was when someone ends a relationship all of sudden and for no good reason- a bit like you and Daddy I guess-&#39;

&#39;_Evie_.&#39; It was Evie&#39;s turn to look scolded. Mummy softened, reminding herself that it was a word she had only just learnt. &#39;Go on with your story.&#39;

She took a few moments to compose herself before continuing; &#39;and so anyway, the boys said Neil had been very sad about Sophie and had cried during a Maths lesson at school. James and Vincent- that&#39;s two of the other boys- felt bad for Neil because they&#39;d also been dumped before and apparently it&#39;s not very nice. So, to make things better, James and Vincent came up with a plan that they would all go to the beach and surf and joke-to take Neil&#39;s mind off it. Everyone agreed that that was a good idea: Ryan, Josh, Kit and Leo- that&#39;s the rest of the boys- and so they all came. They then told me that they used to come to the beach a lot when they were younger and it always made them happy, but they hadn&#39;t been for a while because &quot;stuff&quot; had gotten in the way. But now that they were back they were happy again, and they were happy because they remembered all the happy times they used to have on the beach and they realised that they could be happy here again… So yeah.&#39;

&#39;So yeah? That&#39;s it?&#39;

&#39;Yeah that&#39;s it.&#39;

 &#39;You didn&#39;t even ask them about why they called the beach _Cobalt Cove_?&#39;

 &#39;Nope.&#39;

 &#39;Why not?&#39;

 Evie reached forward and picked up the half-eaten jam sandwich and stuffed it in her mouth, just the same way Mummy had before they&#39;d gotten out of the car in the first place. &#39;_Because_,&#39; said Evie, through a thick mouthful that Mummy didn&#39;t bother to comment on, &#39;I don&#39;t think they did name it after all.&#39;

 &#39;And why do you think that?&#39;

 &#39;Because they weren&#39;t hard and cold at all. They were warm and soft, like Daddy used to be.&#39;

 &#39;Oh darling,&#39; whispered Mummy as she stared out at the greying horizon. She was thinking about the last time she&#39;d been to that stretch of coastline. Twelve years ago with Daddy, before Daddy had been a Daddy and before Mummy had been a Mummy. They&#39;d been happier times.

A spurt of giggles suddenly came exploded from the passenger seat. Mummy whirled around. &#39;What? What&#39;s so funny you little rascal?&#39;

 &#39;It&#39;s just funny that I was right,&#39; said Evie, that cheeky smile widening with every word.

 &#39;Right about what exactly? You got the cobalt thing wrong.&#39;

 &#39;Yeah.&#39;

 &#39;Yeaaaah. So what&#39;re exactly do you think you were right about young lady?&#39;

 &#39;_They were_ talking about girls.&#39;
