_Urgh __. _Qué rápido pasa la vida!_

Santo was snoring again last night. Not his fault, those collapsed sinus&#39; of his wheeze and whimper like a wounded animal. Want to help but then he never accepts any. Off he pops at the crack of dawn to god knows where, not even a backwards glance. Awfully attractive all those years ago mind, what with that flinty stoic stare. Now spend nights in decade-old sheets caked in residual sweat. How _does_ he sweat in this weather?

That _puta_ of a crack in the window. Icy wind whipping exposed skin. Must get up. Off we go, quick potter outside. Another day slumped crippled, humpbacked over fat bloated bags of rice cakes- could be worse I suppose, could be one of those… Ah here they come now! Look! It&#39;s our delectable heroes. Shhh, can&#39;t let them know I&#39;m thinking in their tongue. One too many Pynchon&#39;s left lying around. My little secret…

 Appearing over the faint orange mist that hovers over cracked Tupizan streets stroll three _amigos_. Junk ladled, bronze shouldered statue folk, limbs licked with ink, muscles rippling like flags in the chilly breeze, ready made for the pantheon.

 Oh no wait, what&#39;s this? That one&#39;s got a bit of a cough and, wait- is that a _rash_ on that one&#39;s face? Yes! Oh my god it is and it&#39;s disgusting. Gunky red wounds dripping with citric-looking puss. Must&#39;ve been some allergic turn for the worse. Those Ayahuasca trips aren&#39;t as glamorous as they seem, hey? To be fair to the boy he&#39;s got that omnisicent glint in his eye now all right. Knows his name reflected backwards in the silvery pools are proof of his palindrome. Silly boy. Honestly. What would your mother say?

 &#39;Cuanto?&#39;

 &#39;Que?&#39;

 Bit of a rumbly tummy. Must have been Santo&#39;s mouldy quinoa. Never learn.

 &#39;Er, cuanto para…&#39; The boy points at one of the bloated bags.

 &#39;Viente.&#39;

 &#39;Okay.&#39;

 His fingers scurry through his belt bag looking for the right note. The haggard old woman in her little black cholita struggles to hold back a girlish giggle.

 &#39;Gracias,&#39; says the boy. His fragile eyes are narrowed against the winter sun, which is fresh, fragrant and blinding. No thank _you_ chico_._ That&#39;s at least twice the going rate.

Feigning a croke that speaks of her destitute state down there on the dusty pavement, the haggard old woman gives a gummy send off- her two stumps of yellow teeth close to liberating themselves from that wrinkled mouth.

A few other lumpy women are beginning to emerge from other splintering doors now, propping themselves amongst more bags of tastless chaff, lining the main road like gargoyles. Husbands are strolling gruffly too, into battered pick-up trucks to find more of these bleary-eyed gods, nestled up in the nooks of the town, attics with bunk beds, hammocks in basements. More will appear soon, rolling down those tired tracks searching for the next step in their journey of self-discovery. Won&#39;t find it at the bottom of that bottle _honey_, and you sure as hell won&#39;t find it on those glaring little screens you have in your pocket. Ah, maybe you will- maybe you can. Santo always said scepticism was the ugliest form of thinking. Well, all the good it did him, the old-…

Ah, maybe there is something in that. Tummy still rumbling. Feels a bit worse now- tinged by something else. Ooo what is that? Is that hunger? Or the beans from last night? No wait, that&#39;s good old empathy bubbling around down there. Hm, strange. Gobble up some more coca leaves that&#39;ll sort it out. Lovely. Mind you, watching that sorrowful kid nibbling on a rice cake, hard not to squirm. Tattoos are a suit of bravado. Long hair the only thing he loves. Escape hasn&#39;t quite worked out for there has it kiddo? Didn&#39;t realize your problems would pack themselves as surely as your passport. All up there in your head, look, you can see those demons dancing in those glazed eyes. Absent from the present, tormented by the past, and that old future isn&#39;t looking too fresh either, huh?

Oh look Santo is back from his invented chores. Marching up the street, gait laced with purpose, strangely handsome in the morning sun. Won&#39;t say a word but we all know he&#39;s popped back because he&#39;s forgotten his lunch. Bless that man, my chubby, sweating, snoring rock of a man. Can&#39;t even cook quinoa but there he is. He&#39;s always there. He&#39;ll always be there.

Contentment etches itself into every one of the creases that year on year recede deeper and deeper into the weather-beaten skin of the this haggard old lady. Her two yellow teeth glint gold in the morning light. No money of course, no prospects, but as she giggles away with her lumpy neighbour about finally breaking wind, the backpackers turn and with blank expressions reach to freeze this image on their phones. The tyranny of time defied. Well done lads, for how quickly does life pass otherwise?
