  He was always the first one to wake up after a night out, and that morning was no different.
  <br>
	The kitchen downstairs was a real mess. Empty cans littered the floorboards; sickly juices seeped into the cracks. Grease-streaked dishes froze on the verge of collapse, and the stench of fester was everywhere. At the windows, the black, blitz-duty curtains kept the outside world at bay, and the inner one shrouded in darkness.
  <br>
	It all made him feel suddenly very sick; a rising wave that went beyond repulsion at the smell or the decay. He couldn’t stay in there. He had to leave.
  <br>
	Blinking and squinting his puffy eyes against the morning light, he forced himself to look up at the sky outside. A dappled rose tint was warming to gold beneath the blue, and a faint breeze tickled his face. It was still a little hazy, but that would burn off soon enough all right. It was going to be a beautiful day.
	Not that anyone else was there to share it.
  <br>
	The street that he lived on was empty. As he began to wander down the pavement he realized that others were too. The only noise that reached him was the faraway hush of faraway cars that were leaving the city. He peered around corners and alleyways, into shop fronts and bedroom windows, but to no avail. Ordinarily he may have found it eerie, but today he just shrugged and decided to forget other people. He continued to follow his feet as they steering him this way and that with an agenda of their own.
  <br>
	Down by the river he found himself a bench. Nailed to the wood was a shiny gold plaque that gleamed as it caught the golden threads of sunlight. In memory of Colin, it read. The letters were proud and neat and he was sure Colin would have felt sick at just how proud and neat they were. That was all he was now, four words on a bench. And the worst part was that it made Colin seem like the type of bloke who just sat around all day. There was none of the action or adventure of his life, none of the colour of the noise. The tapestry of his existence, rich and complex, was now reduced to a line of symbols that- however bright now- would soon be eroded by the acidic waste of pigeon shit. What about that time Colin marched through Paris to find the German girl who’d worked with him at the L’Hôpital Hôtel-Dieu? Or the time he surprised William for his fortieth with those pretend tickets to Mars? Or the time-
  <br>
	He knew he was getting carried away. He had never even met Colin.
	He got back to his feet with a sigh, but as he did, people suddenly surrounded him, like they’d just walked through a portal. They were all in the midst of their lives, most wearing sunglasses, others with caps pulled low. He didn’t question where they’d come from but he did watch them with intrigue. One man was standing by the river, with his finger on the handle of a pram. He was rolling the thing gently back and forth. It was hard to tell whether he was being tender and sweet, or whether he was weighing up whether to let in roll into the water.
  <br>
	His eyes glanced to another, a woman in a suit. She was chewing a sandwich like a cow chews its grass; with sadness, disinterest, with the knowledge that this is as good as the day will get.
	On the bridge a couple dangled their limbs over the water below. Their shoulders were slumped and their lips remained unmoved. The silence was deafening, and that’s when he decided that he couldn’t bear it any longer.
  <br>
	‘Excuse me,’ he said, to a women walking by. She stopped and looked side to side at each of her shoulders, as if the devil himself was dancing on them.
  <br>
	‘What’s the best story you’ve ever heard?’
  <br>
	The woman stayed silent for another second or two, throwing more glances to her left and right. When she seemed happy that no one would notice, she burst into laughter. ‘What?’ she said, as if he’d told her a shocking piece of gossip, ‘what’s the best story I’ve ever heard? Well…’
  <br>
	And she told him, right there and then. It was the story of her house. When she was eighteen it had been caught in a fire, and the fire had been her fault. It had been her grandparent’s before her mother had inherited it. It was large and spacious and in the summer smelt of lavender and honey. But she was bored there too often and liked to get high in her bedroom. One morning, when she could smell smoke from the kitchen, she knew she’d forgotten to stub out her last joint. The house began to crumble remarkably quickly. For all of the years it had stood resisting the weather, it took only an hour or so when the storm was on the inside. By lunchtime, the great wooden timbers had buckled like deckchairs.
	The woman’s eyes grew misty and big, so he left her in thought. He noticed that when he started walking away she was shaking her head. ‘He couldn’t have been real’ he imagined her saying to a friend later that day, ‘no one just asks that sort of question.’ But he was real, and he was glad that he had listened to her. A purpose was beginning to sharpen his blurry mind.
  <br>
	Soon he was speaking to another person and asking them the very same question, this time it was a man with two children. The children had been busy feeding the ducks for a good ten minutes, but he’d just been staring at the ground, his hands scrunched into balls, his eyes sullen, his posture slumped. Now he was looking at him like it was the first human face he had ever seen. It was a curious, delicate, doubtful look, but then he began to tell his story and the sparkle that was dancing in his children’s eyes- the same sparkle that he had long since forgotten- was being remembered.
  <br>
	The story was longer than the woman’s and less well told, but he told it nonetheless. It was about a priest who lived by the cliffs. The priest liked to walk, and each day would follow the same path along the top of scraggy rocks. From the path he could always see his bellowed church, will its sagging roof and its wonky door. One day out on his walk he saw another man, who was not in a good way. He was swaying right on the edge, his coat flaying in the wind. The priest approached him slowly and asked him what he was doing. ‘What does it look like old man? I’m doing it, and none of your clever words will stop me’. The priest looked at the jagged black rocks below, and nodded. ‘That’s fine,’ he said, ‘I’ll leave you in peace, but before I do, can I ask you one question?’ The man grew impatient, weary of his tricks, but it was only one question and that wasn’t very many at all. ‘Do you see my church over there?’ And the man nodded that he did. ‘I need help with the roof and the door. Can you see? The roof is sagging and the door is all wonky, and I can’t very well do it on my own.’ The man reluctantly agreed as long as the priest would then leave him alone. ‘Of course, of course, kill yourself later, I just need you now.’ It was these words that the man lingered on later when he walked away from the cliff for the second time that day. He was needed, even for a moment, and that was good enough for now.
	The man in the park fell silent when he’d finished his story too. The kids had started tugging at his jeans, but it took a while before he realized. Instead he just looked at him, with the same curiosity. And then he called him an angel, before responding to the tugs. ‘An angel,’ he said again leading his children off hand by hand. There were three of them now with those sparkly eyes.
	More people began to tell him stories by the river as the afternoon wore on. Some he listened to were sad, others uplifting; some were kind of funny- just the way this one woman told it anyway. But the one thing that struck him on each occasion was the look on their faces when they’d finished. It was like they’d woken from a lifelong sleep.
  <br>
	By the time it grew dark he knew that he would have to stop listening. He’d been at it all day and even been kissed and hugged. But he grew tired now, and hungry and he thought about the piles of dishes and the cans of beer back at his house. They would stain if he left it much longer, maybe they already had.
	But when he entered the kitchen he noticed the curtains were open. It was still dark of course but the stars were shining brightly through the glass. A pale white light fell upon the pristine carpet. By the sink, there were no dishes at all. Curious, he thought. It was as if an angel had come.
