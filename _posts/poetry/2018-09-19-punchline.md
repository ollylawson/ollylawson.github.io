I’m trying to make peace
with my warring immaturity
but it’s hard to accept you’ll know more
than the nothing you know now
and not grow impatient
especially when the ‘more’
means more of nothing.
Still, strange comfort lies
in the absurdity of our learning and
the futility of our mistakes.
Make haste then in ignorance
stumble unrelentingly
failing to learn
and failing in order to learn
before learning to fail in style and
then maybe one day you’ll look back
and forgive yourself for the
mad rush you were in and maybe
you’ll even chuckle at how seriously
you thought the world had to be
when really
it’s a joke,
an endless gag
with a punchline that gets
delivered in a whisper when
we finally reach the other
side of the veil.
