One day your wings may twitch

and beat against a ringing of the bars,

where quivering plumes see-saw

against the cold and silent ground;

and spine has arched, feathers bleached

by closet winds that rage,

as unruffled guards sit deathly still:

ears deaf, hands tied—mind a cage.

&nbsp;

Outside grey, yet greying still

with flaking panes diseased.

Frosted shatter of teacups warmth

draws crimson from trembling grasp.

Blood not bleeds but meaning seeps

as bird begins to tweet;

you sense your chance to reconvene

a freedom buried deep.

&nbsp;

Minutes tick as clock face thaws–

a moment hangs untouched;

guards have gone if ever there

leaving horizon dripping gold.

Hands once tied dissolve the bars,

mind hushing teacup storm;

warble away my pretty friend,

the dawn is yours once more.
