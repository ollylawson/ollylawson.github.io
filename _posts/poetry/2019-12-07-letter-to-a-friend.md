We played the game
despite the rules
or maybe just to spite them-
for in them lay
imagined threats
from inward-facing foe
that drove and drove
in search of more
though more is moor
in dreamy scapes
all misted gorse
and muddied shapes
disorientating till the end-
and muddied further
by addled brains
of senseless brawn
seeking clearer light
in bluish dawn.

<br>

You remember
as well as I
the passing of the day
when sooted eyes
sought comfort
in technicolored orbs
that faded purple
on Horizon’s blur
leaving trace of eternal boy
who’s legacy
(bar mournful skies)
lay buried in more and more.
Though not to say
pursuit is done
if done for Honest’s sake
for fresh truths lie in
newfound games
with no rules (or hearts) to break.
