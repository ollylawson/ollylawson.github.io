The homeless men didn’t steal from me,

It was the ones with everything and nothing.

They sat cackling in high-backed chairs,

Staring at photographs of blacks and whites and browns;

moving through the streets with No Fear Queers,

as if it were the most natural thing in the world!

But then I shouldn’t say I was robbed-

Perhaps ‘short-changed’ somehow instead,

Because I’ve been taught to bear the blame,

And carry the crucifix of my guilt

Through the careless years of youth

And into whatever apocalypse awaits.

<br>

To say ‘betrayal’ assumes my innocence

Which everyone knows is false.

No one is innocent in a world of agents and the sick.

But this was never meant to happen,

How can the Home just vanish like that?

Was it washed off by the acid rain?

Or frightened away by the migraine?

Can you hear that noise? Deafening in the dark:

The pulse, the pulse, the thudding pulse

Of expectation, compulsion and booze.

A cocktail for mental implosion,

Spilling grey through cracks of black.

<br>

‘But where do you go to now?’ they choke,

As they rouse their thumping heads,

‘Anywhere but here,’ if you want to know the truth,

But they don’t, no one does, not anymore,

The truth has become as unrecognisable

As the dead sculptor festering next door.

Does god even know where we’re headed?

Where would he feign call a home?

‘It’s where the heart is!’ says the neon sign,

But what if your heart is broken?

And scattered across the world,

Like looted treasure from a pre-Christian time?

<br>

Nature’s obligation is to move to propitious ground.

We owe that to ourselves, to our species, our line,

Even if those alien lands carry all those nasty germs.

‘Bubonic plague and dengue fever-‘

‘And that’s if you’re a lucky boy!’

But what if the bacteria is already there?

Underneath the scab-toughened skin,

Trapped in the forehead, beneath the jutting thorns,

Only stoicism protects the wound from worse.

‘Pain breeds strength, don’t you remember?’

But pain breeds “strength” by killing off the weak.

And maybe that’s us, without the miracle up our sleeves.

<br>

It breaks more than it makes, this place,

This city of false dawns, blue dreams;

Humpbacked shells, puncture-lunged martyrs,

Without mention of honourable cause.

Marching to the arrhythmic beat,

Of unrequited jobs in vacuous towers,

at the top of steps built on labourers backs.

And the only sign of vegetation in this place

Is the tumbleweed sweeping through and

down the streets all the way out of town,

for good and for ever;

the only freedom in sight.
