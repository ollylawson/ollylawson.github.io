What of the lot of the Gypsy Child,

the child who wanders free?

What of the lot of the Gypsy Child,

“the child who fails to see”?



The Gypsy Child, he knows no clock,

nor wishes to know its constraint;

for his only wish is to walk barefoot,

and be naked without complaint.



The Gypsy Child will smile and wave

as the Trivial trudges by,

for the Gypsy Child is happy deaf,

to whispers of the Trivial lie.



The Gypsy Child will climb the trees

and echo the harmonic call,

of Nature’s poignant songbirds,

though they sing of their Master’s fall.



The Gypsy Child will swim the seas,

but his tears now flood the tide,

for below him lies a desert,

once the pearl of Shiva’s pride.



He’ll reach the shore and slump to shade

rendered weak-kneed by the grief

that the world he thought he ran freely in,

was mere bounty to the Ultimate Thief.



But does he cry and mourn all night,

raging curses at the star’s ill-sight?

Not the Gypsy Child, the bare-foot one,

for freedom is the source of light.



“What of the lot of the Gypsy Child?”

“The child that failed to see?”

“No not that one, the naked thing-

the one that always seemed so free.”
